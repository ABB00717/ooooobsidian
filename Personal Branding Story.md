# Core Value
- Information
	- Literature
		- "The Last Question"
		- "The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect"
		- and writing notes, writing makes me feel alive
	- Computer
	- Music
		- "Queens of the Stone Age - Songs for the Deaf"
		- "Interpol - Turn on the Bright Light"
		- "Disasterpiece - Hyper Light Drifter OST"
	- Philosophy

- Crafting
	- Programming
		- I consider Programming as a kind of "creative writing".
